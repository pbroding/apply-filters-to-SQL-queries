<h2>Apply filters to SQL queries</h2>
<h4>Welcome to my cybersecurity lab, a fascinating exploration of the power of SQL in filtering and querying databases. In this comprehensive project, I've harnessed the capabilities of SQL to demonstrate the importance of precise data filtering, a critical skill for those working with databases and information security.</h4>

<h4>Two Accessible Formats: To ensure you can access the content in your preferred way, I've provided the completed lab report in two formatsâ€”Microsoft Word and PDF. This flexibility allows you to choose the format that suits your needs.</h4>
